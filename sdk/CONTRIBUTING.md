# Contributing

MojoAuth PHP SDK is [MIT](LICENSE) licensed and accepts contributions via GitHub pull requests. This document outlines some of the conventions on development workflow, commit message formatting, contact points and other resources to make it easier to get your contribution accepted.


## Contribution Flow

This is a rough outline of what a contributor's workflow looks like:

- Create a separate branch from `dev` branch to base your work.
- Make commits of logical units.
- Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
- Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
- Make sure to proofread the content before submitting
- Submit a pull request to the original repository.
- **Please ensure that you raise a PR on `dev` branch instead of `main`.**

#### Commit Messages

Please follow the below format while writing commit messages

```
  title: One line description about your change
  <Blank Line>
  description: An optional description of your changes.
```
## Reporting New Issues

- Please specify what kind of issue it is.
- Before you report an issue, please search for related issues. Make sure you are not going to open a duplicate issue.
- Explain your purpose clearly in tags(see **Useful Tags**), title, or content.

 Group members will confirm the purpose of the issue, replace more accurate tags for it, identify related milestone, and assign developers working on it.

- Type: What kind of issue, e.g. `feature`, `bug`, `documentation`, `performance`, `support` ...

Thanks for your contributions!
